<p>
	Redesigned John Carltonâ€™s Copywriting blog, giving it a professional broadsheet newspaper look. I ran a number of heatmap and conversion funnel campaigns to increase list opt in rates and product sales. Using Google In Page Analytics and Clicktale to confirm findings, moving opt in box above the fold, highlighting product section, adding most popular posts section. Split testing a Text About page vs an About page with photos finding photos to win with 80% uptake.
