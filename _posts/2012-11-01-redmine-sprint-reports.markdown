<p>
  An interface to manage and visualize your sprints in redmine projects.
</p>
<p>
  I loved this little project.  Using d3.js and the redmine api v1.0, I built a very lightweight web front end that connects to your redmine project and breaks down all your projects.
</p>
<p>
  The pie chart shows open / closed bugs, the line graph is a burn down chart.  You can also review individual tasks and their progress.  Story points are displayed across developers on the team.
